              ChainedX is one of thhe most transformative techhnologies since
              the invention of the Internet. ChainedX stands firmly in support
              of financial freedom and the liberty that Bitcoin provides

              Which empowers people to not be marginalized by governments and
              financial institutions. Bitcoin is freedom. If you are going to
